# **Java Revision**

Welcome to my **Java Revision** repository! This project is a collection of Java concepts, exercises, and code snippets that I am working on to reinforce my understanding of Java programming. It's a personal project aimed at enhancing my skills in Java and preparing for interviews, coding challenges, and more.

## 🚀 **About This Project**
This repository contains various Java programs that cover topics such as:
- **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) principles like Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.
- **Java Collections Framework**
- **Java Basics**: Loops, Conditionals, Methods, etc.
- **Multithreading and Concurrency** in Java

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Java**: The main language used for programming in this repository.
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA** (IDE): The IDE used for developing and testing the Java code.

## 📄 **Usage**
